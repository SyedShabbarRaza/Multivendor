react-router-dom is essentail to do url routings.

Center => mx-auto || my-auto

w-full => Take Width Of Your Parent


uncaught exception: Is a synchronous error that was not caught with a try...catch block.

An unhandled promise rejection happens when a promise fails, but you don’t use .catch() or try/catch with async/await.

When I was new with flutter and node, Each time when a response came from backend I had to match the response message's characters to check wheather the reponse was success or failure 
But with the use of error handling each time the frontend automatically came to know that the response is incase of failuer or success because incase of failue I have used new ErrorHandler("something went wrong",400) then automatically goes to catch block of axios.

Redux Toolkit is used here in this project to store the whole data of the user,It will prevent fetching data again and again that we need at many places.

Redux=> Is simply a browser side Database

Use vh when:
You want something to take up a portion of the screen regardless of its parent.

Use % when:
The parent has a fixed height and you want a child to take part of it.

when fixed is used then it require left,top,right and bottom.

justify-center → horizontal centering of children
items-center → vertical centering of children
Both require the parent to be flex or grid

Gradient Syntax in tailwind=>bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-400 to-teal-500


Redux is only used when we need data at more than 1 place in our website.
